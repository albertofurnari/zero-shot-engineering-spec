abstract: >
  Zero-Shot Engineering (ZSE) is a technical specification for inference-time
  control of Large Language Models via structured prompt design.
  The specification defines normative control patterns, operational constraints,
  and applicability boundaries for reducing output variance without modifying
  model weights. The full technical specification is distributed separately
  under controlled access.
