# Changelog

All notable changes related to the **public overview, metadata, and
access policy** of Zero-Shot Engineering (ZSE) are documented in this file.

The canonical technical specification is distributed separately
under controlled access.

## v1.1.0 — Specification Maturity Update (2025-12-17)

### Added
- Explicit clarification of controlled access to the full ZSE technical specification.
- Formal acknowledgment of economic trade-offs between prompt-based control and fine-tuning approaches.
- Declaration of cognitive and maintenance costs associated with ZSE prompt design.
- Normative hierarchy for constraint resolution (Schema > Constraints > Role).

### Changed
- Repositioned the repository as a **public overview and metadata index**, not as the full normative specification.
- Updated README (EN/IT) to remove claims of open normative scope.
- Aligned citation metadata (`CITATION.cff`) with access-controlled distribution.
